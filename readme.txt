This is a piano application written in Python (https://www.python.org)
with the aid of the pygame library (https://www.pygame.org/lofi.html)
for graphics and the pyo library (http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/)
for sound processing

Features:

- 2 octaves (starts at C4 and goes up to B5)
- multiple notes can be played at once
- keyboard or mouse input
- sample-based synthesis
  - I only use one audio file (for the A4 note) and the rest
    of the notes are synthesized from that one audio track

1. Install Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org)
